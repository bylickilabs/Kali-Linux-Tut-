### 10061 Failure - Kali Linux

```yarn
Under certain circumstances, such as the update to the WSL when starting the interface accessible via "kex".
the error message often occurs after a successful update on.:
```

| kex unable to connect to socket: connection refused (10061) |
|---|

```yarn
The problem can be fixed quickly!
You don't need to do anything other than the original to Download.
```

| wsl_update_x64 |
|---|

```yarn
With windows 11, you can uninstall it by right-clicking on the directory to be downloaded on your computer and displaying the additional options.

Then restart your computer once, just be careful

After rebooting, just reinstall it and run Kali's regular update.

Since Kali is not uninstalled, but only the "wsl" update is reinstalled, the files should be preserved.
